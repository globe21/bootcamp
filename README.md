These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the _____ file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

  - _TODO: Enter the playbook file._

This document contains the following details:

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.


 jump box is a system on a network used to access and manage devices in a separate security zone. A jump server is a hardened and monitored device that spans two dissimilar security zones and provides a controlled means of access between them.


Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly available, in addition to restricting traffic to the network.
A load balancer is a device that acts as a reverse proxy and distributes network or application traffic across a number of servers. Load balancers are used to increase capacity (concurrent users) and reliability of applications.

 
Load Balancing plays an important security role as computing moves evermore to the cloud. The off-loading function of a load balancer defends an organization against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. It does this by shifting attack traffic from the corporate server to a public cloud provider.




Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the _____ and system _____.
 Filebeat monitors the log files or locations that you specify, collects log events, and forwards them either to Elasticsearch or Logstash for indexing.

 
 

Metricbeat is a lightweight shipper that you can install on your servers to periodically collect metrics from the operating system and from services running on the server. Metricbeat takes the metrics and statistics that it collects and ships them to the output that you specify, such as Elasticsearch or Logstash.
Metricbeat helps you monitor your servers by collecting metrics from the system and services running on the server, such as:

 



The configuration details of each machine may be found below.
_Note: Use the [Markdown Table Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to add/remove values from the table_.

| Name     | Function            | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway  |      10.0.0.6   | Linux             
| Web 1     |   Webserver      10.0.0.7   | Linux                              
| Web 2     |   Webserver      10.0.0.8   | Linux                    
| Web 3     |   Webserver      10.0.0.10 | Linux                                

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the Jump Box machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- _TODO: Add whitelisted IP addresses_

Machines within the network can only be accessed by ssh.
Which machine did you allow to access your ELK VM? What was its IP 13.92.154.17
Elk was accessed from the Jump Box ansible container

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes/No              | 10.0.0.6 13.92.154.17    |
|          |                     |                      |
|          |                     |                      |
Inbound access is limited to  port 22 and the ip of my local computer
### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- _TODO: What is the main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible?_You can create and maintain multiple servers.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- _TODO: In 3-5 bullets, explain the steps of the ELK installation play. E.g., install Docker; download image; etc._
- ...
- ...

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

 
### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
List the IP addresses of the machines you are monitoring_
10.0.0.7
10.0.0.8
10.0.0.10

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
Web 1, Web 2, Web 3

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
In 1-2 sentences, explain what kind of data each beat collects, and provide 1 example of what you expect to see. E.g., `Winlogbeat` collects Windows logs, which we use to track user logon events, etc._

 

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the _____ file to _____.
- Update the hosts file to include the ip address of the machine being updated
- Run the playbook, and navigate to elk server to check that the installation worked as expected.


 
_TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- _Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it? Install-elk.yml â€“ jumpbox container
- _Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?_The playbook and the hosts file.
- _Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running?
http://40.122.24.253:5601/app/kibana#/discover

_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._
